#### Ninja Vanish:
Cost: 5 Karma Source: Data Trails

Even the best sometimes get clipped. Maybe
you’re in a host, holding off some IC, but there
are just too damn many of them. Maybe you’re in
the middle of a firefight and the enemy hacker is
getting the best of you, and you’re moments away
from having your deck reformatted, when sudden-ly,
the Matrix glitches. A little localized reset saves
your bacon. Just like that. What are the odds, neh?
Maybe GOD is on your side? That can’t be—you
must just be that good.
As a Free Action, the character can spend 1 point
of Edge to remove all marks a single opponent has
on him. Note that in cases where other targets were
sharing marks with your target, such as IC in a host,
the others also lose their marks.

#### Digital Doppelganger:
Cost: 7 Karma Source: Run faster

The Matrix is a big place, and with a world so con-
nected and so tied to identity, there are bound to be
some crossed signals somewhere. The character’s
digital identity, including their spending habits, li-
censes, travel records, and data trail have all been
cross-linked with someone else’s identity. Anyone
doing research on him has a hard time locating any
information and faces a +2 threshold for Matrix
Searches for tracking the character on this ID. The
character must be a SINner, and this quality should
be linked to a particular SIN.

#### Data Anomaly:
Cost: 3 Karma Source: Data Trails

An incessant code tinkerer, you know very ef
fective ways to hide your icon, making it look like
nothing more than a piece of errant code. You gain
+2 dice when resisting a Matrix Perception test
while running silent.
Unfortunately, whatever it is you’re doing to hide
yourself has one little flaw—sprites, those mysteri-
ous creatures of the Matrix, can spot you instantly,
exactly as if you weren’t running silent at all.

Programs:

- Stealth: +1 Sleaze
- Lockdown: Link-lock someone you attack automatically.
