# Max Taggart (Omega):
- Fake Sin: Criminal
- Fake Licenses: Ware, Guns, Personal Security (profession)

## Negative Qualities:

### Combat Junkie:
If the character is in a stressful situation, they must make a Composure (4)
Test in order to restrain themselves from just punching their way out of the
situation. If they are following a plan and an unexpected event occurs, their first reaction will be to opt for violence unless they succeed in an Intuition + Logic (4) Test and remember to stop and think about whether there might be a better option. The character is always free to not make a test and just give into their violent instincts—and deal with whatever consequences follow.

### Uneducated:
Max is considered “unaware” in Technical, Academic Knowledge, and Professional Knowledge skills they do not possess (see Skill Ratings, p. 129), and they may not default on skill tests for those skills. The gamemaster may also require the character to make Success Tests for
ordinary tasks that the typical sprawl-dweller takes for granted. Additionally, the Karma cost for learning new skills or improving existing ones in these categories is twice the normal rating (including at character creation), and it’s possible the character will never learn some skill groups belonging to these categories.

### Hobo With A Shotgun:
If forced to stay somewhere above Squatter, the character will be at –2 to all his Mental attributes as he becomes confused, erratic, and agitated until such a time as he is able to spend a day in a Squatter or Street lifestyle to rezone himself.

## Positive Qualities:
### Inspired:
The quality grants the character an additional Street Cred of 2 (p. 372, SR5) among fellow artists familiar with his reputation. Inspired characters also gain a +1 dice pool modifier for all Artisan skills or Performance skills they possess; the player must choose which category the quality applies to when it is chosen, and the quality can only be selected once.

### Toughness:
Max Taggart gains a +1 dice pool modifier to their Body when making Damage Resistance tests.


### Magic Resistance (2):
Max Taggart receives 2 additional die for Spell Resistance Tests.
