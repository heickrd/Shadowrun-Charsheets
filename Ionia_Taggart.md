## Positive Qualities:

### Catlike: 
They also claim they land on their feet when dropped, though they tend not to let
people test this. This quality adds a +2 dice pool modifier to Sneaking skill
tests.

### First Impression: 
Whether infiltrating a gang, making contacts in a new city, or wrangling an
invite to a private meet, the character gains a temporary +2, dice pool modifier
for relevant Social Tests such as Negotiation and Con during the first meeting.
This modifier does not apply to second and subsequent encounters

### Legendary Rep:
The character has a solid (2 Karma) or legendary (4 Karma) reputation within a
certain group. He did something amazing for the group once; old members talk
about it with fond memories and new recruits want to find out all about it. The
character gets a Reputation bump with a certain specific group; +1 for a solid
rep, +2 for a legendary rep. Even if the character goes on to do negative things
to that group, his reputation is such that people want to believe it’s a just a
misunderstanding.


### Negative Qualities: 

The origami swan can mean only one thing. For some reason, a character with this
quality feels it is necessary to leave their calling card to announce their
involvement in a job. The signature is usually some specific item, symbol, or
technique the character uses that identifies their participation. For those who
know the character and their signature, the signature is easily identified.
Anyone performing a test to identify the character’s handiwork or track the
character is given a dice pool modifier equal to the character’s Street Cred and
Public Awareness combined.

### Wireless
The suit uses the extra information about your surroundings and also gives you a
+2 dice pool bonus to Sneaking Tests for hiding.
